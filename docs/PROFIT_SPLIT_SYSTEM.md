# üí∞ Payverge Profit Split System

## Overview

The Payverge Profit Split System is a flexible revenue distribution contract that allows the platform to automatically distribute profits among multiple stakeholders, partners, and team members. The system supports configurable percentage-based allocations and provides transparent, automated profit sharing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Separate Contract Design
- **PayvergeProfitSplit.sol**: Handles all profit distribution logic and beneficiary management
- **PayvergePayments.sol**: Routes platform fees to profit split contract
- **Clean Integration**: Minimal coupling with automatic fee routing

### Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Distribution**: Support for up to 50 beneficiaries with custom percentages
- ‚úÖ **Automated Payments**: Automatic profit distribution with single transaction
- ‚úÖ **Transparent Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all distributions
- ‚úÖ **Upgradeable**: Uses OpenZeppelin's UUPS proxy pattern
- ‚úÖ **Security Focused**: Role-based access controls and emergency functions

## üíº Beneficiary Management

### Adding Beneficiaries
```solidity
// Add a new beneficiary with 25% allocation
profitSplit.addBeneficiary(
    partnerAddress,
    "Strategic Partner",
    2500  // 25% in basis points (2500/10000)
);
```

### Updating Allocations
```solidity
// Update beneficiary percentage
profitSplit.updateBeneficiaryPercentage(partnerAddress, 3000); // 30%

// Remove beneficiary
profitSplit.removeBeneficiary(partnerAddress);
```

### Beneficiary Limits
- **Maximum Beneficiaries**: 50 active beneficiaries
- **Percentage Range**: 0.01% to 100% (1 to 10000 basis points)
- **Total Allocation**: Cannot exceed 100% across all beneficiaries
- **Minimum Distribution**: $1 USDC minimum per distribution

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Fee Collection
Platform fees from PayvergePayments are automatically routed to the profit split contract:
```solidity
// In PayvergePayments.sol - platform fees are routed automatically
if (address(profitSplitContract) != address(0)) {
    usdcToken.safeTransfer(address(profitSplitContract), platformFee);
    profitSplitContract.depositForDistribution(platformFee);
}
```

### 2. Manual Deposits
Additional funds can be deposited for distribution:
```solidity
// Deposit additional funds for profit sharing
profitSplit.depositForDistribution(amount);
```

### 3. Profit Distribution
```solidity
// Distribute specific amount
profitSplit.distributeProfits(1000 * 10**6); // $1000 USDC

// Distribute all available profits
profitSplit.distributeAllProfits();
```

### 4. Automatic Processing
1. **Validation**: Ensures sufficient balance and active beneficiaries
2. **Calculation**: Computes payout for each beneficiary based on percentage
3. **Distribution**: Sends USDC directly to each beneficiary's wallet
4. **Tracking**: Records distribution details and updates beneficiary stats

## üìä Example Distribution

### Scenario: $10,000 USDC Platform Fees Collected

**Beneficiary Setup:**
- Team Member A: 40% allocation
- Strategic Partner: 35% allocation  
- Advisor: 15% allocation
- Reserve Fund: 10% allocation

**Distribution Results:**
- Team Member A receives: $4,000 USDC
- Strategic Partner receives: $3,500 USDC
- Advisor receives: $1,500 USDC
- Reserve Fund receives: $1,000 USDC

**Transaction Details:**
- Single distribution transaction processes all payouts
- Each beneficiary receives USDC directly to their wallet
- Complete audit trail with distribution ID and timestamps

2. **Referral Costs**: Referral commissions are separate from profit distributions
3. **Net Revenue**: Only net platform revenue (after referral costs) is distributed
4. **Balanced Economics**: Ensures sustainable profit sharing while maintaining referral incentives
