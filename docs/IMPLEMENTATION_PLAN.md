## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack Alignment

**Existing Stack (Web3 Boilerplate):**
- Backend: Go + Gin + SQLite (GORM)
- Frontend: Next.js 13+ + TypeScript + NextUI + Tailwind CSS
- Smart Contracts: Foundry + Solidity
- Authentication: SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum)

**Payverge Extensions:**
- USDC payment processing
- QR code generation and management
- Bill splitting algorithms
- Real-time payment tracking
- Business dashboard with analytics

### Key Design Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds on the previous
2. **Testable Components**: Small, isolated features that can be tested independently
3. **Extensible Architecture**: Clean interfaces for future feature additions
4. **Mobile-First**: Guest experience optimized for mobile devices
5. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live payment tracking

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Payverge platform incrementally, with each phase building upon the previous one. The plan leverages the existing Web3 boilerplate infrastructure while adding the specific functionality needed for the crypto hospitality use case.

The phased approach ensures that we can test and validate core functionality early, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt based on user feedback and market requirements. Each phase delivers tangible value that can be tested independently, reducing risk and enabling faster iteration.
